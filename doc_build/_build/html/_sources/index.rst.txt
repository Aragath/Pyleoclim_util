Introduction
============

Pyleoclim is a Python package designed for the analysis of paleoclimate data.
Pyleoclim leverages various data science libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) for time series analysis, as well as and Matplotlib and Cartopy for the creation of publication-quality figures. The package is designed around object-oriented :ref:`Series <core_ui>`, which can be directly manipulated for plotting, spectral and wavelet analysis, and other time series-appropriate operations.

Pyleoclim natively "speaks" the language of Linked Paleo Data  (`LiPD <http://lipd.net>`_), which enables it to handle most of the data transformations internally, taking a good chunk of the pain out of analyzing paleoclimate data.
The package is aware of age ensembles stored via LiPD and uses them for time-uncertain analysis. Age ensembles can be generated through the `GeoChronR <http://nickmckay.github.io/GeoChronR/>`_ package, which natively stores them as ensemble tables in LiPD.

Getting Started
===============

The :ref:`installation guide <installation>` provides information on getting the package up and running. Basic familiarity with Python is essential, and many good tutorials exist on the topic.
The main Pyleoclim functions are available through its objected-oriented `interface <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util/blob/master/example_notebooks/pyleoclim_ui_tutorial.ipynb>`_, and are documented :ref:`here <utils_introduction>`. More specialized routines exist as well, primarily for internal use, and are linked to in the "See Also" sections.
A basic introduction to plotting styles in Pyleoclim is provided in `this notebook <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util/blob/master/example_notebooks/plot_styles.ipynb>`_.
More advanced paleogeoscientific workflows that leverage LiPD datasets are available as Jupyter notebooks through `LiPDBooks <https://github.com/LinkedEarth/LiPDbooks>`_.

While convenient for the representation of paleoclimate observations, LiPD is not the only point of entry into Pyleoclim. The :ref:`Series <core_ui>` class is very flexible, and allows to apply Pyleoclim functionality to virtually any timeseries, including instrumental or model-generated data, as Excel spreadsheets, numpy arrays or pandas dataframes. Indeed, Pyleoclim is the workhorse supporting more general `machine-learning functionalities <https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/autoTS>`_ for all manner of timeseries.



Getting Involved
