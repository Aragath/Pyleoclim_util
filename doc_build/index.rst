Introduction
============

Pyleoclim is a Python package designed for the analysis of paleoclimate data.

Pyleoclim makes use of various data science libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) for time series analysis and Matplotlib and Cartopy for the creation of publication quality figures.

Key features of Pyleoclim are its object-oriented :ref:`Series <ui_introduction>` which can be directly manipulated for plotting, spectral and wavelet analysis, and other time series-appropriate operations as well as its ability to manipulate `LiPD <http://lipd.net>`_ files directly, handling most of the data transformations internally.
